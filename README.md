PROBLEM STATEMENT - Students often need to buy or sell stuff from around them like scientific calculators, books or any other thing. Hence, a centralized marketplace for our  college students would be the right place to go as it would make it very convenient for them to trade within the college itself. This way, students can save  money buying used stuff instead of purchasing it brand new.
